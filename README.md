# SEM images segmentation with Tensorflow
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image segmentation.
The aim of this SEM image segmentation study is to identify and analysis of geological objects using deep learning.    

### Requirements: 

* Install anaconda; conda install keras, tensorflow, scikit-image, opencv, tqdm, pandas, numpy, seaborn, etc libraries.


### Dataset: 

* The original image is out allowed size limit. The loaded images are used for demonstration purpose.

### 

### Hardware used: 

* HP-7920 workstation: 56core CPU; 64G memory; GPU Nvidia Quadro P5000.
